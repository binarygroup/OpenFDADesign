# OpenFDADesign
## Description ##
The design prototype, located at TBD, fetches adverse event data via OpenFDA datasets and API, and generates charts and tables according to user-defined filters.
## Technical Approach ##
Our team applied Binary Group’s agile development methodology, ODEA™, to wrap Agile/Scrum with discovery, planning, architecting and DevOps, while ensuring continuous user engagement and alignment from project initiation to completion. We followed the Digital Playbook as guiding principles throughout, and have provided evidence in the repository at [https://github.com/binarygroup/OpenFDADesign/blob/master/Artifacts/Digital%20Playbook%20Mapping.xlsx](https://github.com/binarygroup/OpenFDADesign/blob/master/Artifacts/Digital%20Playbook%20Mapping.xlsx) to trace results and artifact alignment to those principles. In sections a-k below, we describe our approach to Pool One Design:

	
a. A Product Manager was assigned as team leader for Pools 1&2, and given authority, responsibility and accountability for the quality of all prototypes.

b.	In addition, our multidisciplinary, experienced and collaborative Pool 1 Scrum team including an Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester and Front End Web Designer. Labor tracking tools were established to track costs, team collaboration tools identified to maximize communication, and team repository selected and created. During daily Scrum meetings, the combined Pool 1 and 2 Scrum teams met for 30 minutes to review accomplishments, plans and issues. 
 
c.	In discovery, we interviewed two users with subject matter expertise (SME) from both FDA and regulated industry perspectives.

d.	Collaboratively with these SMEs, the Scrum team defined a set of prioritized Open FDA data analysis capabilities valuable to both regulatory and industry researchers, and established Persona, related Scenarios and Use Cases to assist human-centered design. We also conducted open web research to better understand challenges, risks and disruptions between FDA and regulated industries. The result was a set of epics and related user stories that formed our initial Product Backlog, also informing the Pool 2 effort.

e.	To enhance visibility, designers leveraged both an industry data visualization design style guide and previous data visualization experiences.  For example, our visual designers: 
	(1)	Chose visualizations that take the analyst/researcher through a story, encouraging exploration through interactive filters;
	(2) Presented only relevant information in an effective and intuitive visualization;
	(3)	Employed consistent dashboard color schemes and layouts using pie charts, bar charts, and tabular formats starting with the most important information at the top left, cascading down to more detail at the bottom.

f.	Through requirements analysis leading to key decisions, the Product Manager led an assessment of the Product Backlog, as well as available open source technology options and team skill sets, and selected project technologies. The Pool 1 team then designed an initial prototype using an initial dataset from the Open FDA web site. Open source technologies including R, the Portia web scraper, and FDA’s R API library were leveraged to collect, filter, analyze, and correlate the FDA Open datasets.

g.	During user review of this initial prototype, the Product Manager and user SME assessed gaps that were found in the datasets that impacted usefulness of the scenarios, and prioritized and revised the Product Backlog given these constraints.  The Scrum team then held a Sprint Planning meeting and decided on the set of Product Backlog user stories to move to the Sprint Backlog. Given the short delivery timeline, only one Sprint was initially planned, but a subsequent Sprint was added when GSA extended the delivery timeline. The Scrum team identified tasks for each of these user stories, and committed to deliver those.

h.	The Pool 1 Scrum team met with both the user SME and other users several times during the Sprints to review and get feedback on revisions to the design prototypes to better support the selected user stories. This feedback and the design prototypes were also shared with the Pool 2 Scrum Team to help them identify the data needed to extract from the API as well as data views and filters needed to deliver the best visualizations to support the selected user stories.  Sprint Review meetings were held with the user SME to review and accept each design prototype.

i.	The design prototypes were tested to ensure on a variety of mobile and fixed platforms to ensure responsive design goals were realized.

j.	Installation instructions were developed to describe how to install and run the prototype on another machine.

k.	Instructions describe downloading openly licensed and free visualization software that allows the prototype to be executed and examined, as well as uploading the prototype into an openly licensed and free cloud platform that allows it to be further extended. The design prototype URL identified above is supported by that platform.
